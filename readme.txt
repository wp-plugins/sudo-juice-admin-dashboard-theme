A simple, light-wight, dark Wordpress admin dashboard theme.

== Description ==

This theme is a simple asthetic change to the current wordpress dashboard for those who are looking for a bit more contrast and darkness without installing a heavy plug in with lots of configuration.

(Though I've listed this as 3.2.1 minimum, it is only a CSS change and may work with earlier versions, it isn't tested though)

== Installation ==

1. Upload sudo-juice-admin folder to /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress - the theme will automatically display upon activation

Done!


Uninstalling is as simple as deactivating the plugin.
